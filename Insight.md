3. The age range of our employees varies widely, with the youngest being just 20 years old and the oldest at 57.

11. On average, employees stay with their respective departments for about 8 years, with Legal and Auditing boasting the longest tenures, while Services, Sales, and Marketing have the shortest.

# Limitation

1. We found some records with negative ages, so we removed those from our analysisâ€”totaling 967 records. We only included ages that were 18 years and older.
2. Additionally, we noticed that some termination dates were set far in the future, so we excluded those as well (1599 records). We only considered termination dates that are on or before today.
